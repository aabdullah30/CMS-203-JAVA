/*Class: CMSC203 CRN3156
 Program: Assignment # 2 
 Instructor: Professor Ahmed Tarek
 Summary of Description: This program plays a game with the user to guess a number. The user has seven attempts to guess a number from 0 to 100 correctly. If the user fails to guess using their seven attempts, then the program will give the user the answer. 
 Due Date: 02/14/2023 
 Integrity Pledge: I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
 I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
